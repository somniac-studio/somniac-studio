Hi I'm Som!

I'm foolish and don't use github often, and I'm all over the place for what projects I feel like working on.
Primarily, I'm an artist! So this coding thing is a side gig for me, I hope my projects are helpful! I always use an MIT License and keep it all open!


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on using three.js to make a fancy portfolio page.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python.....
